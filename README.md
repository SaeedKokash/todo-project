Day06 - Assignment Questions:

## Q1: What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far? ##

A1: I noticed that the HTML is easy with practice and doesn't take alot of time, but I'm still struggling with the CSS and it takes alot of time to achieve what I want.

## Q2: How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment? ##

A2: for the HTML part, it took me about an hour to complete, however for the CSS part, it took about 5-6 hours to complete, with alot of tutorials and testing and I still need to learn more and more about styling because I believe its very important.

Day07 - Assignment Questions:

## Q1: What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far? ##

A1: I believe that I still need to practice more and rewatch the recorder lectures to revise the material so far as I've forgot alot of things since I took the freecode camp course.

## Q2: How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment? ##

A2: It took me about 30 mins to solve the first part of the task. The second part was a bit challenging as it could be done in many ways, it took about 1.5 hours to complete and I still need alot of practice. I thought that it will take longer actually but it went well.
